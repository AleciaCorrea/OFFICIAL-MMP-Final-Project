        <h1>"We Got Food at Home"</h1>
        <p>Have you ever been in this situation?</p>
        <p>There has been a time in all of our lives when we were outside with our family and we passed a fast food chain or perhaps a food item you have been craving in the grocery store. Your next words either were "Mom, can we get Mc Donalds?" or "Mom, can I get this bag of chips?". Your dream of eating something good is crushed by hearing "You got that Mc Donalds money?" or the ever so famous "we got food at home".  </p>
